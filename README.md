Football Match Score Prediction using Random Forests

Overview

This project predicts football match scores using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. It leverages historical match data and incorporates web scraping to keep the dataset up-to-date. The goal is to build an accurate and dynamic model to forecast match outcomes based on various performance metrics.

Features

Random Forest Model: Utilizes a robust ensemble learning method for accurate score prediction.

Web Scraping: Automatically fetches and updates datasets from reliable football data sources.

Data Analysis: Performs in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key match factors.

Custom Datasets: Processes and structures historical football data for model training.

Prediction Pipeline: End-to-end workflow from data collection to score prediction.

Technologies Used

Python (with Jupyter Notebooks)

Scikit-learn (Random Forest implementation)

BeautifulSoup/Selenium (for web scraping)

Pandas
